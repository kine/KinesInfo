    "body": "New blog May be you already noticed that my original blog on dynamicsusers.net (original URL was https://www.dynamicsuser.net/nav/b/kine) is gone. I am building new one from scratch. May be it is time to begin something new and cut off the Dynamics NAV history.\nBecause todays it is easy to use GitHub as a platform for the blog (and thus using git and vscode to \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; the articles), I decided to use HUGO as the framework. Another side of this is, that my blog is \u0026ldquo;opensourced\u0026rdquo;, thus you can see everything what is there and if you have some need to fix something, you can easilly post pullrequest.\nI hope that you will find it worth to read it.\nEnjoy it!\n",

    "body": "About me I have more than 35 years of experience with software development and IT in general. In the year 2001, after finishing university, I joined the NAV world in NAVERTICA company as NAV developer. Having a wide area of knowledge in programming languages and connected areas is helping me to understand “how it works” and is giving me background for solving different tasks. For the last years, I am working more with GIT, Powershell, and Azure DevOps. I am a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) since the year 2004.\nWhat I know I have learned mostly on my own (many trials\u0026amp;errors), because I started when there was no internet and even no books about computers. Our country lived in communism and my first computer Atari 800XE was bought in Austria (thanks to my parents for this decision). But all that gave me something, what cannot be taught.\nIn personal life I have beloved wife and my free time activity is to play PC games/simulators like IL-2 Sturmovik, MS Flight Simulator and other.\n",
