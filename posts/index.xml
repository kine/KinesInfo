      <description>On Directions EMEA in Milan I delivered session about Architecture of PTE for Business Central. I was trying to find some rules when or why you should or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t split your PTE into multiple apps. Now I will try to catch this into this article.
Split or not to split Some partners are putting everything into one app per customer. Some are splitting all to separate apps based on different rules like per process, per area etc.</description>

      <description>New blog May be you already noticed that my original blog on dynamicsusers.net (original URL was https://www.dynamicsuser.net/nav/b/kine) is gone. I am building new one from scratch. May be it is time to begin something new and cut off the Dynamics NAV history.
Because todays it is easy to use GitHub as a platform for the blog (and thus using git and vscode to &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo; the articles), I decided to use HUGO as the framework.</description>
