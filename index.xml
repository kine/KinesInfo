      <description>New blog May be you already noticed that my original blog on dynamicsusers.net (original URL was https://www.dynamicsuser.net/nav/b/kine) is gone. I am building new one from scratch. May be it is time to begin something new and cut off the Dynamics NAV history.
Because todays it is easy to use GitHub as a platform for the blog (and thus using git and vscode to &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo; the articles), I decided to use HUGO as the framework.</description>

      <description>About me I have more than 35 years of experience with software development and IT in general. In the year 2001, after finishing university, I joined the NAV world in NAVERTICA company as NAV developer. Having a wide area of knowledge in programming languages and connected areas is helping me to understand “how it works” and is giving me background for solving different tasks. For the last years, I am working more with GIT, Powershell, and Azure DevOps.</description>
