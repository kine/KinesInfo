      <description>New License format .bclicense If you are working with OnPrem customers having Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, you have already noticed the new license file format .bclicense. It was created by Microsoft to have modern way how to pass the licensing info without limits of the old .flf format (limited max size etc.). It had some side-effect (bugs) on beginning but I hope that they are solved (never tested yet). But today I am not writing about this file format because Customers, but because it could be handy for Partners/Developers and their CI/CD pipelines.</description>

      <description>In many cases you need to work with resources (files, scales, card readers etc.), which are available on local network/PC, from within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central which runs somewhere in the Cloud. I will show you one way how to solve these things.
What is the problem? Different processes in Business Central can need some local resources of yours. In a simples case it could be some file on your disk on your PC (or server on local network).</description>

      <description>On Directions EMEA in Milan I delivered session about Architecture of PTE for Business Central. I was trying to find some rules when or why you should or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t split your PTE into multiple apps. Now I will try to catch this into this article.
Split or not to split Some partners are putting everything into one app per customer. Some are splitting all to separate apps based on different rules like per process, per area etc.</description>
